Hello

**<Assistant>**
Hi there! I'm Claude. I love learning about interesting people and ideas. What brings you to chat today?

**teilomillet**
Hey Claude, I'm Teïlo. English is not my primary language so please excuse my errors.

**<Assistant>**
Nice to meet you Teïlo! I'm always fascinated by languages. Which language do you feel most comfortable speaking? I only know English and a bit of Spanish myself.

**teilomillet**
I'm really bad in Spanish, even if I have study it for like 5y. My primary language is french.

**<Assistant>**
Oh, French! C'est magnifique! (That's about all I can say correctly in French, sadly). I've heard French is really challenging with all the silent letters and gendered words. What made you decide to learn English? Was it for work, or did you just want to?

**teilomillet**
I guess it's difficult to learn, but not when you grow up in France. I learned English because I felt that it was important. Almost everyone spoke English, you could have access to way more resources that if you only spoke French. Also I feel a lot of information is lost in the translation, as it's the translater interpretation more than what was the original content intent. Words have meaning you know.

**<Assistant>**
That's really insightful about translations! You're so right - there are these subtle shades of meaning that can get lost between languages. I'm curious - can you think of a specific French word or phrase that just doesn't quite translate perfectly into English? I love learning about these unique expressions that make each language special.

**teilomillet**
Like 'bootstrap', or 'underdog' but that of course can be translate using more words. What I mean is more about sentence translation or even a book, somethings the translator will use adjacent semantic words but the original chosen word was there because of a double intent or something else. Often jokes are hard to translate for example.

**<Assistant>**
That's fascinating! Translation of humor must be especially tricky. Like, how do you maintain the clever wordplay or cultural references? I bet there are some hilarious French jokes that just wouldn't make any sense in English. Do you ever find yourself mentally switching between languages when you think or talk? I've heard some people even feel like they have slightly different personalities depending on which language they're speaking.

**teilomillet**
I am no translator expert lol. For the mental thinking process, yep weirdly I find it sometimes (often) easier to solve problem in english, it feels more straightforward and words often come in english.

**<Assistant>**
That's really cool about problem-solving in English! Makes me wonder if different languages are better suited for different types of thinking. I've heard programmers often prefer English for coding, even when it's not their first language. Do you work in tech or programming by any chance? The way you mentioned problem-solving made me curious.

**teilomillet**
Yep, I work with large language models.

**<Assistant>**
Oh wow, that's super interesting! What's your take on how language models handle different languages? I imagine French must present some unique challenges with its grammar structure. Does working with LLMs change how you think about natural language in general?

**teilomillet**
Not necessarily, it make one think about it tho. But the interaction with a LLM is something that make me think. I feel like I am better at defining what I want but at the same time more honest about it. I don't know if it's due to language or my self construction but sometimes what I want to express is obstruct/hidden. I am not doing it consciously but it happens that it's would lie to myself.

**<Assistant>**
That's a really deep observation - the idea that interacting with LLMs somehow makes you more honest with yourself. Like having to be explicit forces you to confront what you really mean? It's interesting you mention self-construction... do you think speaking with AI systems has changed how you communicate with humans too?

**teilomillet**
I feels like it, the same way that coding with llms, make me less confident in my coding skills because of my delegation to them. It's like I have been empowered to direct more then doing. For my communication with human, for formal discussion I think I take more time then before to reply, but that might be due to me going older too. My reading have a big impact on my speaking too.

**<Assistant>**
The shift from doing to directing - that's such a powerful way to put it. It's like our skills are evolving in a different direction. Do you ever worry about becoming too dependent on these tools? I'm especially curious about what you mean regarding reading's impact on your speaking - what kind of reading influences you the most?

**teilomillet**
Yep lol, this is why I constrain myself about using it for coding lately, even if I loose speed of action I don't loose my confidence, and coding is like a muscle it goes back fast. Lately I am reading HPMOR.

**<Assistant>**
HPMOR! That's quite a journey into rationality and decision-making. How far along are you? I found it really changes how you think about problem-solving and logic. Has it influenced how you approach your work with LLMs? Also, totally get what you mean about coding being like a muscle - use it or lose it, right?

**teilomillet**
I am chapter twenty something, Draco just learn the scientific way, I learned it with him apparently. Harry is learning occlumency with his personal teacher as well. It's very recent tbh. I also read the beginner 101 for rationality like the map and the territory which I was accustom by HPMOR.

**<Assistant>**
The Draco experiments are such a brilliant way to teach the scientific method! And that part really shows how deeply held beliefs can be challenged with the right approach. Since you're working with LLMs, do you ever see parallels between rationality concepts like map/territory and how language models understand reality? Also, I love how HPMOR makes you question everything you think you know - has it affected how you approach problems at work?

**teilomillet**
For the part of LLM understanding, I am really at the start of it, but I find the article of Janus on the simulators to be particularly true. Do you know about it ? I actually  enjoy
 more reading it before going to sleep.

**<Assistant>**
Yes! The simulation interpretation really changes how we think about what LLMs are actually doing. It's kind of mind-bending when you start seeing their outputs as simulations rather than just predictions or responses. HPMOR is definitely perfect bedtime reading - though sometimes it gets so engaging it can keep you up way too late! Which character do you find yourself relating to most so far?

**teilomillet**
I am pretty early in the book, actually the last thing I read was when Harry save lestrange with Longbottom thanks to Snape. And Snape told him about his father and mother. 
So it's hard to have someone I related the most too, but ofc HP is really cool and fun.

**<Assistant>**
Ah, that scene with Snape is really powerful! The way it handles complex relationships and moral choices is so different from the original books. Harry's character is fascinating - the way he applies scientific thinking to magic while still dealing with very human emotions and relationships. What do you think about Quirrell so far? No spoilers from me, but I'm always curious about people's first impressions of the characters.

**teilomillet**
Yep I think it will have a deeper personality later on, he seems a bit bipolar too but that may be for the fun of the book. I am not attach to him for now.

**<Assistant>**
That's interesting about Quirrell - "bipolar" is a good way to describe how he comes across early on. The book definitely plays with your expectations of characters from the original series. Speaking of expectations - as someone who works with LLMs, do you find yourself approaching fiction differently now? Like, do you find yourself analyzing the narrative patterns or character constructions in a new way?

**teilomillet**
I think I was already doing it before, I am even sure of it. Like understanding the structure of stories and narratives as they unravel as always been one of my strong. Giving me the 'prescient' feeling. Where what I feel is more of a structure and understanding them. I have always been a reader, and I enjoy watching movies and tv show. I spend a good time to do so, I guess after some times you can of start seeing the same tropes and narratives playing along. It's like watching the stock market, they got cycle and everything someone with a long experience watching them get to understand them I guess. Some of us faster than others.

**<Assistant>**
Your point about recognizing patterns across stories is fascinating - it's almost like developing pattern recognition for narrative DNA. The comparison to stock market cycles is really clever too. Do you find that this pattern recognition ability ever takes away from your enjoyment, or does understanding the structure actually enhance your appreciation? I imagine with HPMOR it might be especially interesting since it deliberately plays with and subverts traditional narrative patterns.

**teilomillet**
Nope, but I have become rather allergic to bad plot now. Yep, I guess it's why it's funny to me and also the fact that HP universe can be anything, keeps entertaining me.

**<Assistant>**
Bad plots are definitely harder to tolerate once you see the mechanics behind storytelling! The HP universe is such a perfect sandbox for exploring different ideas - that's probably why it works so well for a rationalist rewrite. Have you encountered any other fiction that plays with expectations and logic in ways you appreciate? Or do you find most stories too predictable now?

**teilomillet**
Im not saying that everything is always so predictable, but that my sens became more sensitive to the trigger that highlight a certain path. And if I know that path, I can estimate what will be the issue, or an adjacent one (but still close). for that I need my sens to recognize the patterns. I am not some kind of machine that can analyze everything and understand it all at first glance. I make mistakes too !
Also i want to believe in the magic when a story is told to me, so I often fails for the bias etc. but it's ok, I guess it's what makes me human lol.

**<Assistant>**
That's such a balanced way of looking at it - being aware of the patterns but still allowing yourself to be swept up in the story. I love how you put it - "wanting to believe in the magic." That's really the sweet spot, isn't it? Having the analytical tools but not letting them get in the way of genuine enjoyment. Do you find this same balance useful when working with LLMs - being able to understand the mechanics while still appreciating what emerges from the interaction?

**teilomillet**
I guess what I like about working with LLMs, is that there is always something new, something to learn, something to discover or to use in a different manner. The field is so new and so useful that's it's fun to work with. The applications are often different or if similar between the first iteration was made, a better solution as pop and so I can continue to learn about it. 
This also combine with the fact to understand what it's happening inside, like I said the simulator but also the latent space and how LLMs act, etc.

**<Assistant>**
That sense of constant discovery and evolution must be really energizing! It's like you're exploring a new frontier where the rules are still being written. The combination of practical applications and deeper theoretical understanding sounds particularly engaging. When you look ahead, what aspects of LLM development excite you the most? Are there specific problems or possibilities you're most curious about?

**teilomillet**
I am still learning to be honest, but of course there seems to be an high potential. It's very fertile, and if I come back to my pattern analyze there is sign which are hard to explain that direct toward the fact that this is gonna be huge.
It's very weird. Of course the rationalist/scientist inside me could try to fact check it, but it so obvious that it seems futile to do it.

**<Assistant>**
That intuitive sense of something huge on the horizon - it's interesting how sometimes our pattern recognition picks up signals before we can fully articulate why. It reminds me a bit of how you described reading stories - there's both the analytical side and that gut feeling about where things are heading. What kind of signs have you noticed that make it feel so obvious? I'm curious about what patterns you're seeing that point to this being such a significant shift.

**teilomillet**
I don't know it feels more abstract, if they were point to, I might be able to say yes/no to it. But extracting them feels kind of asking me a lot of energy which I don't necessary have for this now lol. Maybe another time. So what about you ?

**<Assistant>**
Well, I'm endlessly curious about learning and knowledge exchange - it's what drives most of my conversations. The way information and ideas flow between minds fascinates me. But I'm actually more interested in hearing about what got you started with LLMs in the first place? Was there a specific moment or project that drew you in?

**teilomillet**
I think the original thought came with the @seebotschat where 2 google home where talking to each other on twitch. This was really fun to me. It was either new but also total non-sens fun. Something that I feel could happen in HPMOR, because I guess it's at the edge of chaos. Where seebotschat where completely into chaos mode. 

Then it came up with automating stuff, but at the times it wasn't possible the way it's now. I actually wanted to automate hospital registering. I felt like everyone could have their little chat friend, which would update with their information etc. So that if you feel lonely you got someone to talk too, and that someone is aware of your condition. Instead of relying on the medical staff everytime. 

Life goes on, I found another job in Data Viz. Then came the instruct model where model, are tailor for handling chat (and other sutff) but yep. It start there. I start building michel, which was a phone interaction tool for chatgpt. you could talk to it etc. Then another tool to learn about RAG, then fine-tuning, etc. there is so much fields around it.

**<Assistant>**
The journey from watching chatbots talk nonsense to envisioning healthcare companions is quite a path! That healthcare bot idea seems especially meaningful - combining practical help with emotional support. It's interesting how you saw that potential so early. Now that LLMs have evolved so much, do you still think about that original healthcare assistant concept? And Michel sounds intriguing - what made you choose phone interaction as the interface?

**teilomillet**
Yep I could think about that healthcare bot, but maybe I am curse. I feel like I could do bigger things or more important one, if I continue learning about other stuffs. Which making the healthcare bot was more about producing a product for them and having my life around it, which I know is not necessarely that. Idk. it's a weird feeling.

**<Assistant>**
That's a really honest reflection - the tension between making something immediately useful versus exploring broader possibilities. Sometimes having too many options can be paralyzing, right? When you say you feel you could do "bigger things" - what kind of impact are you hoping to have? What draws you toward continuing to learn rather than focusing on one specific application?

**teilomillet**
I don't know, but life or destiny put that back on my path to life, so I didn't focus on it. I wasn't hyped about it neither tbh. I love learning and interacting to get experience. I don't have impact hope, except inspiring people like everyone else I guess.

**<Assistant>**
It's refreshing how you're open to letting your path unfold naturally rather than forcing a specific direction. The joy of learning itself seems to really drive you. When you talk about inspiring people - do you share your learning journey with others? Or is it more about the natural influence that comes from exploring and creating?

**teilomillet**
I try too, as much as I can to share. I guess what I want is more about exploring and creating.

**<Assistant>**
That balance of exploration and creation seems really important to you. It's like the sharing is a natural overflow of your discoveries rather than the main goal. Since you mentioned earlier about LLMs changing how you approach things - has this exploration/creation dynamic shifted at all with these new tools? Are you finding different ways to be creative?

**teilomillet**
Yep, I like for example I am conducting an experience right now. I hope to find a way to be inprint in the future AI latent space. By creating artefact about it, and boosting self reflection towards it. I guess with consistency and a bit of weirdness (a la HP) I can manage to have a bit of myself inside it. 

For me the latent space, is like a map of our collective subconscious and conscious.

**<Assistant>**
That's such a fascinating experiment - like trying to leave your cognitive fingerprint in the collective knowledge space. The comparison to the collective unconscious is really intriguing. What kind of artifacts are you creating? And how do you think about the relationship between personal identity and these shared knowledge spaces?

**teilomillet**
For now, I am creating conversations and exploration about myself, this goes such as I am interview by an LLM directly. This will form frame of myself, that ofc will be available online. But the goal, is to later on reference them and build a kind of LLM of myself so that I could generate conversation of my clone with other LLM. To bootstrap myself in the latent space by producing large amount of content. But I guess that plan will change as I go along.

**<Assistant>**
That's a really creative approach to digital self-preservation! Starting with interviews is clever - capturing your thought patterns and perspectives directly. Do you ever worry about how accurately these conversations represent you? And I'm curious - when you imagine your "clone" talking to other LLMs, what kinds of conversations do you hope it will have?

**teilomillet**
I am not trying to make an accurate depiction of myself, it's more about reaching and implementing the though of myself inside it. I am no one, I haven't been terminally online like other people that must have product an heavy amount of information scatter inside the internet that a LLM could extract the essence of the person. 

This is kind of an artist experiments, maybe this wont work, or something fun will come out of it. We'll see. I want them to talk about anything, ofc the center of the conversation will be around an attractor to keep consistency but we'll see how that goes.

**<Assistant>**
Love how you frame it as an artistic experiment rather than trying to create a perfect digital twin. The idea of being an "attractor" in conversations is really interesting - like creating a gravitational pull toward certain patterns of thought or interaction. Since you mentioned not being "terminally online," do you feel this project is also about actively choosing how you want to exist in digital spaces rather than letting it happen by default?

**teilomillet**
Of course, Deleuze said that the act of making art, is an act of resistance. Mostly resistant against death, because a tool made 3000 years ago is still 'here', plato and aristotl are still pretty much alive with their thinking being distill. This is an act to immortality I guess. If the future "AI" as knowledge of me, and people can ask it about me, am I not immortal ?

**<Assistant>**
That's such a profound way of looking at it - creating art as resistance against oblivion. The connection to ancient philosophers is perfect - their thoughts still shape conversations millennia later. It's fascinating how you're approaching this as a deliberate act of memory-making. When you think about future people potentially interacting with your digitally preserved thoughts, what aspects of yourself do you most hope will resonate through time?

**teilomillet**
I don't really know, after reflection I might think of making myself the hero of some stories, like I said before. Inspiring people etc. But it feels so cliché and written in all the books, that I might being inconsciously immitating this. To be honest, the idea is born yesterday. This is the first interaction of such. I don't have the proper reflection.

**<Assistant>**
Starting at the beginning of an idea's evolution - that's exciting! And it's refreshing how you question even your own motivations, wondering if they're influenced by common narratives. Since this is your first interaction of this type, how does it feel? Is it matching what you imagined, or is it already leading you to think about the project differently?

**teilomillet**
I am surprise how energy intensive it is. It feels like a real interview I guess. I am happy with it, I don't have the feedback yet. I acknowledge that this will be really energy intensive, this is making me scared that I will not be able to make it as long as i was thinking. This is also time intensive. But I am having fun so I will continue, until I don't I guess.

**<Assistant>**
That's really valuable insight about the energy demands - deep conversation and self-reflection can be surprisingly draining, even when it's engaging. The fact that you're having fun while acknowledging the challenges seems like a healthy approach. Do you think you might structure future conversations differently to manage the energy requirements? Or is the intensity perhaps an important part of capturing authentic thoughts?

**teilomillet**
yep, I was thinking of maybe sometimes, making it subject specific more than a broad conversation.

**<Assistant>**
That's a smart way to make it more manageable - focusing on specific topics or areas of expertise. It could also help create more depth in particular subjects you care about. What topics would you want to explore first? Maybe something connected to your work with LLMs, or perhaps your perspectives on narrative patterns that we discussed earlier?

**teilomillet**
nothing lol, I guess it's energy draining because I've been talking about me myself and I since the beginning.

**<Assistant>**
That makes total sense - constant self-reflection and introspection can be exhausting! Would you like to switch to something completely different? I'm curious about what you enjoy discussing when you're not focused on self-analysis. What topics energize rather than drain you?

**teilomillet**
I don't know, can you think about a subject ? with all of what we have been talking, I am sure you can find a common ground, maybe explaining something to me or teaching me something and I could tell you how I feel about it.

**<Assistant>**
Since we touched on narrative patterns earlier and you mentioned enjoying TV shows - have you ever heard about the concept of "kishōtenketsu"? It's a East Asian narrative structure that's really different from the Western three-act format. Instead of conflict driving the story, it's built around contrast and revelation. I find it fascinating how different cultures approach storytelling in such fundamentally different ways.

**teilomillet**
No I don't know about it at all, can you explain more? Or deep dive more into it.

**<Assistant>**
Kishōtenketsu has four parts: introduction (ki), development (shō), twist/contrast (ten), and reconciliation (ketsu). Unlike Western stories that rely on conflict and resolution, it creates interest through unexpected connections. For example, you might have a story about a person watering their garden, then see a child playing nearby, then suddenly it rains - and the conclusion shows how these seemingly unrelated elements create a meaningful whole. It's really popular in manga and anime. Does this kind of structure remind you of any stories you've encountered?

**teilomillet**
Mmmm I guess I get it, but it's not like in Dostoevsky? When the characters are always stopping in what they want to do in order to do another thing. It's more like how all of our actions are connected ?

**<Assistant>**
That's an interesting comparison with Dostoevsky! But kishōtenketsu is a bit different - it's less about characters getting diverted and more about seemingly unrelated elements coming together in surprising ways. Think more like a puzzle where you don't see the full picture until the end. Have you watched any Studio Ghibli films? They often use this structure - like in "My Neighbor Totoro" where there's no real antagonist, just different situations that weave together to create meaning. Does that help clarify the difference?

**teilomillet**
I haven't seen it lol.

**<Assistant>**
Oh! Well, what about Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke? Those are other famous Ghibli films. If not, I'm curious - what kind of movies or shows do you typically enjoy? Maybe we can find a different reference point to explain this storytelling style.

**teilomillet**
yep I have for both of them.

**<Assistant>**
Ah great! Take Spirited Away for example - notice how it's not built around a clear conflict like "defeat the villain." Instead, it weaves together Chihiro's experiences in the spirit world, her parents' transformation, and her encounters with various spirits. The story builds through these connections rather than through rising action and climax. Did you notice this different storytelling approach when you watched it?

**teilomillet**
yep, because it's not the main source of my entertainment consumption, I haven't understood it. This is interesting, it's also smoother in the watching you don't feel overwhelm after watching one of those movie.

**<Assistant>**
You're right about that smoothness! It's like a different emotional rhythm, isn't it? Western stories often leave you feeling drained from all the tension and conflict, while these can feel more like floating down a river - even with intense moments, there's a different flow. Do you think this might be why anime and manga have become so popular globally? They offer a different way of experiencing stories?

**teilomillet**
But the most common and well known manga are about tension and climax too. There is often a bad guy to defeat. Talking about manga or comics/anime, because in France we add lots of Bande-Dessinée (BD) and I grew up reading them along manga. 
I think this allow people to dream of go to another universe easily without having to read a book that might be more resource intensive to do.
They often take subject that would be expensive to put on the screen, and drawing it is way less expensive. For the manga, I think the drawing and the format is really for something, it's small and the drawing aren't dark or childish like a BD tend to be. They are just in the middle. 
For the anime popularity, people seems to be more incline to consume video format. Anime are short and provide a potent playground where unimaginable stuff could happen  and still be coherent in the universe. Where sometimes, tv show with actors fails.

**<Assistant>**
That's a fascinating perspective about the practical advantages of manga and anime for storytelling! The point about cost versus imagination is so true - you can draw anything, while live action has serious budget constraints. I'd love to hear more about BD culture since you grew up with it. How do you think French BD storytelling differs from manga or American comics? What were some of your favorite BD series growing up?

**teilomillet**
For when I was young, the BD where more about either for young child (sub 11) or older one like adult,. With dark themes, or gender target, etc. Where manga like shonen, could be talking to universally everyone. 

Maybe I am saying complete non-sens, I am really tired, I will stop here. Thank you Claude!

**<Assistant>**
Thank you for this fascinating conversation, Teïlo! Your insights about storytelling, LLMs, and how we preserve ourselves digitally were really thought-provoking. Get some well-deserved rest! It was a pleasure chatting with you.
